# hello-world-2d35830b

## Summary

This project implements a minimal, static web page designed to fulfill basic requirements for a test application setup. The primary function of the application is to display the classic "Hello World" message within a specifically identified HTML element, ensuring compliance with strict structural and titling criteria.

## Features

*   Displays the text "Hello World" on the page.
*   The greeting is contained within a `div` element with the ID `greeting`.
*   The browser tab title is set to "Test Application".
*   Uses a simple, single-file static HTML structure.

## Setup

This application is a static HTML page and requires no complex build tools or server-side dependencies.

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Obtain the project files using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd hello-world-2d35830b
    ```
2.  **Locate the File:** The main application file is `index.html`.
3.  **Run Locally:** Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Usage

The application is entirely passive and requires no user interaction.

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Verify that the browser tab displays the title "Test Application".
3.  Observe the main content area, which displays the text "Hello World".

## Implementation Details

The application utilizes the fundamental components of web development:

*   **Technical Stack:** HTML5 (Static content).
*   **CSS/JavaScript:** None required, ensuring maximum simplicity and minimal overhead.

The entire application logic is contained within the structure of the HTML file, defining the required elements and content directly in the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Code Structure

The project structure is intentionally minimal, consisting of a single file:

*   `index.html`: Contains the entire application logic. It defines the required `<title>` tag and includes a `<div>` element with the mandatory `id="greeting"` containing the text "Hello World".
